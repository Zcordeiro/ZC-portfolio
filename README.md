## Information

My name is Zeus, I'm a Web Developer with nearly a decade of management experience in the hospitality industry and an ever growing interest to learn new technologies. A problem solver comfortable working in fast paced environments, dedicated to accomplishing goals and completing projects in the most detailed and efficient manner possible.

This webpage you'll find links to all of my programming projects. As I progress through my programming career I hope to update this portfolio and not only add new projects but new technologies and features that improve user experience and interaction with my projects. 

Feel free to reach out for more information!
