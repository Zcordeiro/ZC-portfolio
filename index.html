                <p>
                    Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio! My name is Zeus I'm in my early 30's and live in the Tampa Bay area with my long time girlfriend, 3 cats and our dog. <br> I have been interested in computer programing and software engineering for many years now but have never been able to dedicate enough time really do anything with it. <br> I started working in craft breweries shortly after I turned 21 and became the general manager of a brewery by the time I was 24, I spent the next several years focusing most of my time on my work and really did enjoy the company I worked for and the people I worked with in that time. Unfortunately though I didn't feel like there was anywhere else to grow within that industry and decided this was the time to make a change. <br>
